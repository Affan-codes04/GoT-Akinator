# 🐉 Game of Thrones Akinator App

Welcome to the **GoT Akinator App**, a mobile app that guesses your favorite **Game of Thrones character** by asking a series of yes/no questions.  
Built using **Android** and powered by a **tree traversal algorithm**, this app is basically Westeros meets binary search tree 🤯

---

## 📌 Description

Inspired by the popular Akinator game, this app uses a **decision tree structure** to ask users questions.  
Based on their answers, it traverses the tree to reach a **specific GoT character guess**.

So whether you're thinking of **Jon Snow**, **Daenerys**, or even **Hodor** (Hodor?), this app will try to guess them using smart logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each **node** in the binary tree represents a **yes/no question**
- **Leaf nodes** represent GoT characters
- Based on the user's answer (yes or no), the app **traverses the tree** left or right
- Eventually, it reaches a leaf and displays the **guessed character**
